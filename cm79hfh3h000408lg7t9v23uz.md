I don’t know who finds this blog. But it is just my current status.

I am sick of this way of living. I am Tiered of improving everyday doing my best , being used by others tiered of college tired of studing i just want to be free forever. i don’t want the rest of my life like this staring at the screen 24/7 doing late nights just for marks that do not matter. All of my previous post were ai generated i thought it would make money i guess i was wrong or i don’t know. I have a constant loop of waking up go to college at 8 AM listen to boring lectures that fucking dont matter like where the fuck i am gonna use a raspbery pi in my life and even if i do why i need to learn the spec of different models. And that teacher just judges like “these are the candidates that are elligible for my next semester classes with the juniors“ like i a dumb guy there . Everyone is saying do this do that . Do DSA only DO development do Competetive Programming have good CG it must be 8.5 above. People are not ready to collaborate hackathons are not winalbe . REsume is not good. GOod social skills is reqired . its not just about college i have been doing this since my JEE when i was admited to a coaching center in my 9th class i was like 13-14 years fucking distroyed my teenage life . I dont even know how to talk . I see others some have like a relationship , another girl to talk about the relationship. Rich friends . People doing startups but not telling any one and fucking ignoring it we asked. I think will i have to do this coding for rest of my life but i dont want to live like this ,i want to have someone to talk to understand me . I always stand up and try again in such situation of mixed existential crisis and lonliness. But now it feels like i am done i am not able to do it don’t wory i woun’t take a huge step (you know what i mean) i can’t be selfish for this my parents have epectations for me. I just wanted some support or just some rest.
