Hi, I am Arman Chaudhary, a student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering in India. I am currently in my second year of college. I began my AI/ML journey at the end of July 2024. Since then, I have been reading from multiple sources and different books, but now I am ready to dive into big projects. Currently, I have created some small projects by following tutorials on YouTube, and I am not satisfied with that.

### Here are some of the Courses and books i have read :

* Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize \[2024\]
    
* Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow By- AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron
    

### Here are some of the Projects I have made :

* **YouTube Comments Analysis (using LangChain)**  
    A project that leverages LangChain to analyze YouTube video comments, extracting insights like sentiment, trends, or user opinions using advanced natural language processing.
    
* **GPT from Scratch**  
    Built a basic version of a Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model from the ground up, focusing on understanding the architecture and implementing key components like tokenization, embeddings, and transformer layers.
    
* **Deepfake Detection**  
    Developed a system to identify and flag deepfake media using machine learning techniques, aiming to enhance authenticity verification and combat misinformation.
    
* **Fine-tuned LLaMA 8B for Algebra**  
    Customized the LLaMA 8B model for algebra problem-solving, achieving precise mathematical reasoning and generating step-by-step solutions for queries.
    
* **ResNet from Scratch**  
    Implemented the ResNet architecture from the basics, demonstrating mastery over convolutional neural networks and achieving high accuracy in image classification tasks.
    

### Lessons Learned

After some research i found that doing all these projects is not enough and i myself havenâ€™t learned how to make projects all by myself. So these are the key learning i learned in the previous 6 months:

* Copying from Youtube is not learning.
    
* If you are using a tool dig in and read the documentation on how that tool works.
    
* Do not hurry to a new project.
    
* Always deploy your project.
    
* Write a blog about your project.
    
* Explore Kaggle more.
    

### Future Goals

I will improve myself in the next 6 months and build some cool projects and blog about it here ðŸ˜Š. The community response means to me alot. In end of six months i shall :

* Be a Master in Kaggle
    
* Built 5-7 cool projects
    
* Solve 500+ leetcode problems (it is necessary)
    
* Make my portfolio website better
    
* Win some Kaggle competition
